              places in which they are most familiar. A trip somewhere new seems
              always exactly what our photography needed, as shooting away from
              home consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.

            Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and
            then you will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where
            one edge meets another in delightful geometric harmony, and how the
            ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed when the light is on
            or off.

            The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
            to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different
            angles, with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move
            to the left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house
            again.
